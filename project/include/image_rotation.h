/**

 * This header defines the data structures and function prototypes required to perform

 * transformation matrices and bilinear interpolation to achieve high-quality results,
 * while leveraging multi-core parallelism to improve performance.
 *
 * @note
 * Designed for both grayscale (1-channel) and RGB (3-channel) images. All image data
 * is represented as dynamically allocated 3D arrays of unsigned char.

 * This function performs a geometric rotation on an image, distributing the computation
 * across multiple threads to exploit multi-core parallelism. The rotation is applied
 * counter-clockwise for positive angles and clockwise for negative angles. Bilinear
 * interpolation ensures smooth pixel transitions for non-integer coordinate mappings.

 *                     The structure is updated in place with the rotated result.
 * @param[in] angle Rotation angle in degrees. Positive values rotate counter-clockwise.
 *
 * @return
 * - `1` if the rotation is completed successfully.
 * - `0` if a memory allocation or processing error occurs.
 *
 * @note
 * The function automatically recalculates new image dimensions to fit the rotated image
 * without clipping. Works seamlessly with both grayscale and RGB images.
